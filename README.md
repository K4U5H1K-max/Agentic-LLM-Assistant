# Agentic-LLM-Assistant
A Python AI assistant that evolves from prompt-engineered replies to full agentic reasoning. Integrates LLMs with tools like a calculator and translator to handle single and multi-step tasks using smart, modular logic. Built to showcase agentic thinking and clean code design.
This project is a progressive build of an intelligent assistant using LLMs and tool augmentation. It consists of three levels:

-  **Level 1 – EASY:** LLM-Only Smart Assistant  
-  **Level 2 – MEDIUM:** Tool-Augmented Assistant  
-  **Level 3 – HARD:** Full Agentic AI with Multi-Step Tasks  (still contains some bugs(improper task detection))

Built with:  
- **Groq API** (`llama3-70b-8192`)  
- Python 3.10+  
- `.env`-based key management
